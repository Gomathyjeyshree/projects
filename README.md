This is a weather app that uses the OpenWeatherAPI to display current weather conditions in different locations providing accurate and up-to-date weather information. 
I used basic html css and javascript to create the user interface and integrated the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve real-time weather data. 
The app is fully responsive and provides users with a clear and easy-to-use interface. 
The weather information is presented in a visually appealing way, with icons that make it easy to understand the current weather conditions.
